# Authentication Access Control Implementation

## Task: Remove access to books, members, and transactions on login/register page

### Changes Made:

- [x] Updated `books/views.py`:
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `book_list` view
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `book_detail` view
  - Added necessary imports for authentication

- [x] Updated `members/views.py`:
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `member_list` view
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `member_detail` view
  - Added necessary imports for authentication

- [x] Updated `transactions/views.py`:
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `borrow_book` view
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `return_book` view
  - Added `login_required` decorator to `transaction_history` view
  - Added necessary imports for authentication

### Authentication Settings (Already Configured):
- `LOGIN_URL = '/login/'` - Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
- `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'` - Redirects after successful login
- `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/'` - Redirects after logout

### Testing Required:
- Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access `/books/`, `/members/`, and `/transactions/` URLs
- Verify that authenticated users can access these URLs normally
- Verify that registration functionality at `/members/register/` remains accessible to all users
- Verify that login functionality at `/login/` remains accessible to all users

### Files Modified:
- `books/views.py`
- `members/views.py`
- `transactions/views.py`

### Status: COMPLETED
