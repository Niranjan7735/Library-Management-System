# Member Functionality Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Identified:
The "doubled member page" issue was caused by duplicate form elements in the `add_member.html` template and a redundant form field in the `MemberForm`.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed `templates/members/add_member.html`:
- Removed duplicate `{% csrf_token %}` tag
- Removed duplicate `{{ form.as_p }}` tag
- Removed the custom date input field that was conflicting with the form fields
- Cleaned up the form structure

### 2. Fixed `members/views.py`:
- Updated `MemberForm` to remove `membership_date` from the fields list since it's being set programmatically in the `add_member` view

## Root Cause:
The duplication occurred because:
1. The template had duplicate CSRF tokens and form field rendering
2. The form included `membership_date` as a field, but the view was also setting it programmatically to the current date
3. There was a custom date input field in the template that was redundant

## Testing Required:
- Test the add member functionality to ensure it works correctly
- Verify that the membership date is automatically set to the current
