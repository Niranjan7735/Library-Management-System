# TODO List for UI/UX Improvements

## Completed
- Updated base.html for improved navbar styling and removed redundant CSS imports.
- Enhanced home.html dashboard UI for authenticated and anonymous users with consistent card styling.
- Improved login.html UI with cleaner card styling, form validation, password toggle, and remember me functionality.
- Improved register.html UI with cleaner card styling, form validation, password strength indicator, and detailed input fields.
- Fixed navbar login/register buttons display for non-authenticated users.
- Fixed footer positioning to properly show at the bottom of the page.

## Next Steps
- Run the development server and verify the UI changes on home, login, and register pages.
- Test form validation and interactive features (password toggle, remember me, password strength).
- Gather user feedback for any further UI/UX improvements or bug fixes.
