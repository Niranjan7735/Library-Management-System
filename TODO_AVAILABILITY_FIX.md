# Book Availability Status Fix

## Issue
- Admin transaction history shows all books as returned correctly
- User UI shows books as unavailable even when they should be available
- Discrepancy between transaction status and book availability status

## Root Cause
- Inconsistent logic for updating book availability status during borrow/return operations
- Old logic only set availability to False when borrowing, but didn't properly handle setting it back to True when returning
- No centralized method for calculating availability based on current transactions

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Book Model (`books/models.py`)
- [x] Added `update_availability_status()` method
- [x] Method calculates availability based on current borrowed transactions
- [x] Book is available if borrowed_count < quantity

### 2. Updated Transaction Views (`transactions/views.py`)
- [x] Updated `borrow_book()` view to use new method
- [x] Updated `return_book()` view to use new method
- [x] Updated `borrow_book_form()` view to use new method
- [x] Replaced old manual availability logic with centralized method

## Testing Steps
- [ ] Test borrowing a book when copies are available
- [ ] Verify book shows as unavailable when all copies are borrowed
- [ ] Test returning a book
- [ ] Verify book shows as available after return
- [ ] Check admin transaction history shows correct status
- [ ] Check user book list/detail shows correct availability
- [ ] Test edge cases (multiple copies, partial returns)

## Files Modified
- `books/models.py`: Added update_availability_status method
- `transactions/views.py`: Updated borrow/return logic in all views

## Expected Outcome
- Book availability status should now be consistent between admin and user views
- Books should show as available when there are copies left to borrow
- Books should show as unavailable only when all copies are currently borrowed
- Transaction history should accurately reflect the current state
