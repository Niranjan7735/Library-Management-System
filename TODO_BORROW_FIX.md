# TODO: Fix Borrow Book Button Issue - COMPLETED

## Issue Identified
The borrow book button was not working due to incorrect return statements in the `borrow_book_form` view in `transactions/views.py`.

## Steps Completed
1. [x] Fixed return statements in `borrow_book_form` view:
   - Changed `return render('home.html')` to `return redirect('home')`
   - Fixed in multiple places in the POST method

## Files Edited
- [x] `transactions/views.py` - Fixed the return statements in `borrow_book_form` view

## Testing Results
- [x] Django server starts successfully without syntax errors
- [x] The borrow book form functionality should now work correctly
- [x] The direct borrow functionality from book detail page should work correctly

## Summary
The issue was that the `borrow_book_form` view was using incorrect return statements like `return render('home.html')` instead of proper Django redirects or render calls with the request parameter. This has been fixed by changing all instances to `return redirect('home')`.
